I am a first year Master's student in [Computational Science Engineering and Mathematics](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/) (CSEM) at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/).

I am a machine learning enthusiast. I spend my time reading articles in this field and practice my skills on online datasets.

I was one among the 4 candidates from IIT Madras to bag a Pre-Placement Interview (PPI) offer from American Express for outstanding performance in Amex Analyze This Competition, 2018.
