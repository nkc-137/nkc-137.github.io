Welcome to my website!

I am KAPIL Chandra.

I am a final year student at [IIT Madras](http://www.iitm.ac.in/), pursuing Dual Degree(B.Tech & M.Tech) in [Metallurgical and Materials Engineering](https://mme.iitm.ac.in).

I am a machine learning enthusiast. I spend my time reading articles in this field and practice my skills on online datasets.

I was one among the 4 candidates from IIT Madras to bag a Pre-Placement Interview (PPI) offer from American Express for outstanding performance in Amex Analyze This Competition, 2018.

<!-- All the time I spent exploring materials science, **computational materials science** piqued my interest the most, as a result of which I found myself spending time on learning concepts in this field. Every summer I sought to broaden the horizon of my knowledge in computational materials science by working in labs on interesting problems. In these internships I have explored problems in different length scales (Atomistic, meso and continuum).

I believe in the success of the 4<sup>th</sup> paradigm of materials science which is data-driven discovery of materials. To learn more about this aspect of the field I took up courses in machine learning and deep learning, and I went ahead to work on PSPP linkages. I have written about my work in internships in the projects section of the website. -->
