[Curriculum Vitae](/assets/CV_2018.pdf)

My research interests are:
<ol>
<li> Computational materials science
<li> First Principle Calculations
<li> Atomistic modeling of materials
<li> Deep learning and machine learning
<li> Phase-field modeling
</ol>


Currently, I'm working with [Dr. Satyesh Kumar Yadav] for my Master's Thesis on the development of atomistic potentials for silver nanoclusters using machine learning. And I am working in [Prof. Alexander Hartmaier's] group under Dr. Napat Vajragupta on structure property linkages. Details of the projects can be found in [projects] section of my website.


I am applying to universities for the fall of 2019 to further my studies.
